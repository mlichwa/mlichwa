# Hi, I'm MichaÅ‚ ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Poland, living in Barcelona. I'm passionate about travel, languages and mechanical watches and frankly, most of my side projects have to do with my passions. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Swift and ReactSwift to build iOS projects and ReactJS, PHP ( together with JS and CSS) for building web solutions.

Over the last few years I worked as a contractor on a number of Wordpress sites. In my spare time, I build and launched Watch Case- an iOS app for collectors of mechanical watches and Vorto- a web app for studying in foreign languages.
